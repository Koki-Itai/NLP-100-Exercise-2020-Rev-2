# NLP-100-Exercise-2020-Rev-2


## Abstract
NLP 100 Exercise is a bootcamp designed for learning skills for programming, data analysis, and research activities by taking practical and exciting assignments([NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Rev 2)](https://nlp100.github.io/en/)).

I worked on this exercise in the NLP study group of the Komachi Laboratory at Tokyo Metropolitan University.

## Chapter01: Warm-up　 
Review advanced but important topics of programming, handling strings and text.

## Chapter02: UNIX commands
Experience useful UNIX tools for research and data analysis. Improve programming skills and realize the ecosystem of existing tools by implementing these tools.

## Chapter03: Regular Expression
Extract various information and knowledge by applying regular expressions to Wikipedia markups.

## Chapter04: POS tagging
Obtain statistics of the word usage of the novel, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” by applying a part-of-speech tagger

## Chapter05: Syntactic parsing
Experience analysis and access to dependency trees by applying a dependency parser to the novel, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.”

## Chapter06: Machine learning
Build a document classifier based on machine learning. In addition, learn the evaluation methodology for machine learning.

## Chapter07: Word embeddings
Learn the usage of word embeddings by computing the similarity between words and word analogy. In addition, experience clustering and visualization of word embeddings.

## Chapter08: Neural networks
Learn the usage of a deep-learning framework, and implement a document classifier based on Neural Network models.

## Chapter09: RNN and CNN
Implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by using a deep-learning framework.

## Chapter10: Machine translation
Build a neural machine translation by using an existing tool.
